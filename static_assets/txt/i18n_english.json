"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_2", "Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don\u2019t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I\u2019ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.",

"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_4", "I wouldn\u2019t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it\u2019s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5", "Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it\u2019s time to rock Team GO Rocket\u2019s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pok\u00e9mon!",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_0", "Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that\u2019s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_1", "Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It\u2019s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_2", "Perhaps we\u2019ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket\u2019s devious plans and discover what Pok\u00e9mon Giovanni now has under his control.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_3", "On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_4", "The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_5", "They document a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that\u2019s why Team GO Rocket is here.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_6", "Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pok\u00e9mon?",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_7", "I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pok\u00e9mon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.",

"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would\u2019ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pok\u00e9mon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_1", "It was a tough battle, and the fact that you defeated Mewtwo proves what an amazing Trainer you are.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_2", "Spark, Blanche, and Candela were victorious against the Team GO Rocket Leaders and drove them away, too.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_3", "Thanks to everyone\u2019s efforts, we\u2019ve saved Pok\u00e9mon GO Fest! It\u2019s time to celebrate!",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_4", "Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pok\u00e9mon! Some say this Pok\u00e9mon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_5", "I\u2019m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I\u2019m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pok\u00e9mon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_0", "Phew! Now, I think we should get back to having fun. There\u2019s still time to enjoy the festivities!",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_1", "While this year\u2019s GO Fest was quite a bit different from previous ones, I\u2019m overjoyed that Trainers all over the world could still come together to celebrate\u2014and protect\u2014our beloved Pok\u00e9mon.",
"gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_2", "Even when we\u2019re apart, we\u2019re still united by our love of Pok\u00e9mon. No matter what obstacles appear in your path, you can always count on your Pok\u00e9mon and your fellow Trainers.",

Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pok\u00e9mon GO<br><br>Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pok\u00e9mon GO using your third-party Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Club (\u201cPTC\u201d) account administered by The Pok\u00e9mon Company International (\u201cTPCI\u201d). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the \u201cAccounts with Children\u201d paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pok\u00e9mon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (\u201cParent\u201d) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (\u201cChild\u201d), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child\u2019s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent\u2019s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent\u2019s social security number and the Parent\u2019s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent\u2019s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pok\u00e9mon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child\u2019s access to and use of Pok\u00e9mon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child\u2019s registration on Pok\u00e9mon GO and prevent the Child\u2019s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child\u2019s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child\u2019s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pok\u00e9mon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child\u2019s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pok\u00e9mon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the \u201cHealth App Data\u201d).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pok\u00e9mon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get \u201ccredit\u201d in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pok\u00e9mon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pok\u00e9mon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>",

"quest_dialogue_genesect_2_0", "Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You\u2019re on fire?",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1", "Anyway...the damage can\u2019t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2", "Could it really have been caused by Pok\u00e9mon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pok\u00e9mon for me?",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3", "As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn\u2019t seem to line up with any Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve encountered.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_1", "I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_2", "She shared some notes about a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3", "Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pok\u00e9mon is Bug and Steel type, it\u2019s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4", "This lines up with the damage at the site we\u2019ve been researching!",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5", "One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6", "I\u2019ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon to help us get to the bottom of this.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0", "I can\u2019t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1", "With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we\u2019ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon Genesect!",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2", "I know what you\u2019re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3", "Apparently, when this Pok\u00e9mon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s holding.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4", "I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5", "I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.",

"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_0", "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I\u2019ve come across something...groundbreaking.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_1", "I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls. ",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_2", "At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_3", "These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pok\u00e9mon in particular.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_0_4", "Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_0", "Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_1", "This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon. I wonder if we\u2019ll find another Pok\u00e9mon that will help us solve this puzzle.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_2", "I have one in mind, but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself!",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_1_3", "I\u2019m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we\u2019ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_0", "As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_1", "I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s said that it made Pok\u00e9mon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_2", "Could it be these Pok\u00e9mon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn\u2019t it?",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_2_3", "If the first two Pok\u00e9mon were Regirock and Regice...then there\u2019s only one left that we must research further.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_0", "Excellent work. I believe we\u2019re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_1", "We\u2019re close to coming across the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pok\u00e9mon towed continents with rope.",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_2", "Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!",
"quest_dialogue_gigas_3_3", "Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you\u2019ll make a colossal discovery of your own.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_0", "Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_1", "I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I\u2019ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pok\u00e9mon deep in slumber.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_2", "We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_3", "Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I\u2019ll see if I can find anything about this Pok\u00e9mon in any of my texts.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_0", "Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m sure the resources you\u2019ve earned will be crucial.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_1", "I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that grants wishes.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_2", "I\u2019m still researching the best way to awaken this Pok\u00e9mon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pok\u00e9mon in the area showing signs of distress.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_3", "Could I ask you to investigate these reports?",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_0", "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_1", "Many of the Pok\u00e9mon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_2", "I\u2019d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I\u2019m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_3", "As you return the Pok\u00e9mon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_0", "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pok\u00e9mon in their habitats?",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_1", "Apparently there\u2019s an unusual phenomenon where Pok\u00e9mon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I\u2019ve heard Spark refer to it as a \u201cphotobomb.\u201d",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_2", "I\u2019m eternally amused\u2014and amazed\u2014by the things we learn about Pok\u00e9mon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_3", "These Pok\u00e9mon all seem to have something in common\u2014music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_4", "What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_0", "That\u2019s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pok\u00e9mon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon Jirachi!",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_1", "The ancient text was right\u2014this Mythical Pok\u00e9mon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_2", "Now that we\u2019ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be\u2014I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_3", "It isn\u2019t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pok\u00e9mon in such diverse habitats\u2014not to mention meeting a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon!",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_4", "I\u2019m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I\u2019ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_0", "Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m excited to get started on our next big adventure. ",
"quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_1", "What do we need to do? Well, I\u2019ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.",

"quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4", "Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles\u2014not entire cities.",

"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_3", "If I\u2019m right and this elusive Pok\u00e9mon is a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_4", "But let\u2019s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?",

"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_5", "I think that if we find Ditto, we\u2019ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_6", "Observation will be the best way forward, so let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and get to work!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_7", "Please complete the following tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_0", "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you\u2019ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_1", "This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn\u2019t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_2", "But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon.",

"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_1", "Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_2", "Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto\u2019s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!",

"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_4", "I think our next step is to study more Pok\u00e9mon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pok\u00e9mon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?",

"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_0", "Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_1", "Meltan very well may have split from a Pok\u00e9mon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that can divide into multiple, independent Pok\u00e9mon!",

"quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_1", "Of course, the reason for Meltan\u2019s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pok\u00e9mon somehow split itself apart.",

"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_1", "I can\u2019t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pok\u00e9mon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pok\u00e9mon, it will appear?",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_2", "Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_0", "Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we\u2019ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!",
"quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_1", "I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the weather, but I\u2019ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.",

"quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0", "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.",

"quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2", "It\u2019s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pok\u00e9mon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3", "Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0", "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1", "Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it\u2019s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2", "Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3", "Why don\u2019t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it\u2019ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0", "On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pok\u00e9mon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1", "Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2", "I\u2019m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3", "Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I\u2019ve been startled enough for one day of research!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0", "So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pok\u00e9mon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1", "Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That\u2019s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2", "I\u2019d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned\u2014stay up-to-date with Pok\u00e9mon, even familiar ones!",
"quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3", "Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I\u2019ll be in touch about our next research adventure!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0", "Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can\u2019t help but be impressed by your progress. You\u2019ve done fantastic work in researching Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1", "Now that we\u2019ve researched Pok\u00e9mon that were found in those regions...",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2", "let\u2019s take a closer look at Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Unova region!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3", "I think it\u2019s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pok\u00e9mon from all over the world, there\u2019s always more to learn!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4", "Speaking of discoveries, I\u2019ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5", "I was speaking to a researcher who\u2019s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6", "It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7", "Maybe I could get a few workout tips\u2014I\u2019ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8", "Anyway...let\u2019s do some more research on Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0", "Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1", "These first-partner Pok\u00e9mon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pok\u00e9mon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2", "This Sea Otter Pok\u00e9mon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn\u2019t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0", "I can\u2019t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You\u2019re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1", "Now that we\u2019ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pok\u00e9mon of many Trainers from Unova, let\u2019s shift focus to the Fire-type one\u2014Tepig!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2", "I\u2019m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It\u2019s such a clever use of a skill.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3", "I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0", "Being the savvy Trainer you are, I\u2019m sure you know which type of Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019re going to research next.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1", "That\u2019s right\u2014Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pok\u00e9mon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2", "Perhaps there\u2019s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pok\u00e9mon!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3", "Anyway, let\u2019s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0", "You\u2019re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Unova region.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1", "I can\u2019t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2", "By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve never encountered before.",
"quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3", "I think you\u2019re the perfect Trainer to take this Pok\u00e9mon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I\u2019ll be in touch soon!",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0", "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1", "Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pok\u00e9mon. I guess you could say we\u2019re in a...hairy situation!",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2", "...Uh, moving along...",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3", "Weedle\u2019s horn measures about two inches. It\u2019s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4", "Let\u2019s investigate Weedle further\u2014but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn\u2019t want to get poked by one.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0", "Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research\u2014Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1", "It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and\u2014in my opinion\u2014honkable nose.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2", "I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don\u2019t think to offer me any.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3", "Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle\u2019s Evolution. I can\u2019t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0", "Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pok\u00e9mon didn\u2019t move much, but wow.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1", "Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it\u2019s doing nothing, it\u2019s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2", "And that\u2019s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn\u2019t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we\u2019ve learned so much about what\u2019s happening to Kakuna!",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3", "Let\u2019s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it\u2019s been working on.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0", "Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1", "Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pok\u00e9mon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2", "This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.",
"quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3", "Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn\u2019t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab\u2019s tires!",
"quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_0", "%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.",
"quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_1", "I came to study Pok\u00e9mon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve observed today don\u2019t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!",
"quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_2", "Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pok\u00e9mon around, it almost feels like a safari!",
"quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_3", "Please complete the following research tasks: \n{0}\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n{4}",
